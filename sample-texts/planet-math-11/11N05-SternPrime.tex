\lsection{Stern prime }
		
In this section, let $b,\ d,\ m,\ p$ be integers.

\dfn{
We say that $d$ is \df{positive } iff $d > 0$.
}

\dfn{
We say that $b$ is \df{nonzero} iff $b \ne 0$.
}
		
\dfn{ We say that $d$ \df{divides} $m$ iff $d\ne 0$ and there exists
  an integer $r$ such that $m= d\*r$.  }
	
\dfn{
We write  $\natdiv{d}{m}$ iff $d$ divides $m$.	
}

\dfn{
We say  $d$ is a \df{divisor} of $m$ iff $d$ divides $m$. 
}

\dfn{ Assume that $p$ is greater than $1$.  Then we say that $p$ is a
  \df{prime} iff each positive divisor of $p$ is equal to $1$ or equal
  to $p$.  }

\dfn{ Assume that $p$ is a prime.  Then we say that $p$ is a \df{Stern
    prime} iff there exist no prime $q$ and nonzero integer $b$ such
  that $p = 2\*\intpow{b}{2} + q$.  }

\begin{remark}
These primes were first studied by Moritz Abraham Stern, in connection
to a lesser known conjecture of Goldbach's. Like other mathematicians
of the time, Stern considered 1 to be a prime number. Thus his list of
Stern primes read thus: 2, 17, 137, 227, 977, 1187, 1493. A century
later the list has been amended to include 3 (as in A042978 of
Sloane's OEIS) but no terms larger than 1493 have been found. The
larger of a twin prime is not a Stern prime.
